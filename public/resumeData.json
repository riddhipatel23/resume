Her critical and creative thinking helped us tackle complex challenges across both frontend and backend systems, playing an integral part in delivering high-quality work efficiently. Riddhi's attention to detail and effective communication with team members were consistently impressive. She demonstrated exceptional leadership as a key member of our Grace Hopper program, where fellow graduates looked to her as both a role model and mentor. One memorable moment was teaching Riddhi React/Redux concepts during her internship. She not only quickly grasped these technologies but applied them to real-world scenarios, creating reference implementations that benefited future projects. Her dedication and commitment were truly inspiring, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of her journey.",

She is hard working, tenacious and smart individual. In my personal experience she quickly learnt AWS and implemented a SQL DB in RDS, however she had no previous experience in any cloud technology whatsoever. With minimal guidance she managed to finish the requirement on time. I highly appreciate Ridhi for her efforts and enthusiasm and recommend her for her technical prowess and learning capabilities. Keep up the good work!!!",
